  <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>USP College launched ParentPay in 2009. ParentPay is the web payment service that lets parents pay safely online by credit and debit card to schools/colleges. </p>
<p>USP College will be using ParentPay to pay for college fees, transport fees and book fees. In future, the college hopes to use ParentPay to pay for trips, visits and college catering facilities.</p>
<p>We are hoping that everyone will benefit from this facility. ParentPay is a free, easy to use online service, which gives you the freedom to make payments whenever you like, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This means that the student will no longer have to take responsibility for carrying money into college, which is probably a great reassurance for parents.</p>
<p>To make a secure payment using a debit/credit card, you will need to set up an account via the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.parentpay.com/" target="_blank" title="ParentPay">ParentPay</a> website.<br /><br />Prior to setting up your account, it is advised that you read over the FAQs below.</p>
<p>If you have any queries - please call: 01375 898 607 or alternatively, email: <a href="mailto:parentpay@uspcollege.ac.uk">parentpay@uspcollege.ac.uk</a></p>
