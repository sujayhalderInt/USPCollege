Over the course of the school year, there will be times when you don't do well or where you put everything in and it still doesn't come out right. It happened to me several times over.

Accounting is challenging and requires commitment and an analytical approach and is suited to those with an interest in modern business. It is the perfect way to build your financial skills and can lead to degree level study in Accounting, Finance and Business. It is also an asset if you are looking to go straight into accounting jobs or any job that requires some knowledge of Accountancy.]]></bannerSummary>
