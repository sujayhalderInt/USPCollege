  <mainContent><![CDATA[<h3>Our dedicated Work Experience team, USP Futures, are here to help and support you in finding a meaningful work experience opportunity.</h3>
<p>Recent studies have shown that employers consider work experience to be extremely desirable. Whilst qualifications are hugely important, employers also require candidates to have skills and experience necessary for the workplace.</p>
<p>Preparing you for the working world is very important to us, so that you may be successful in your next step.</p>
<p>Work experience placements provide you with the opportunity to develop your skills; have a better understanding of the industry you want to work in and give you an insight into what it is like to be employed. They can also be great fun and very rewarding and you may even be offered a great reference, a part–time job, holiday working hours, apprenticeships or full-time jobs.</p>
<p>If you are studying a vocational qualification here at USP College then you will undertake a work experience placement of at least 30 hours per year. Some courses such as Health &amp; Social</p>
<p>Care, Early Years and Animal Care include extended work placements where you will attend one or two days a week for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Once you start your course you will be provided with further information about work experience programmes, but it is never too early for you to start thinking about work experience placements and finding an employer who will offer you an opportunity.</p>
<p>Work experience is an opportunity for you to gain experience in your chosen career path in order to develop relevant skills. Equally, it also helps you to acquire employability skills, attitudes and behaviours that are essential for future employment. There will be an opportunity for you to reflect on your performance during work experience and you will receive some form of reference/feedback from the employer.</p>
