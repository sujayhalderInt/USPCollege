  <mainContent><![CDATA[<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>This course will benefit students who want to explore the technical and conceptual possibilities of Fine Art. You will be able to refine your creative skills in a range of materials as well as develop your critical and intellectual understanding of the work of artists, learning how to apply techniques and processes to improve your visual awareness.</p>
<h2>Entry Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Average point score* of 4.5 or above, calculated from all GCSE subjects. Your point score MUST include at least five GCSEs at grade C/4 or above - including English Language or Maths.
<ul>
<li>If your English Language is a D/3, your Maths must be at least a C/4 and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grade C/4 or above in an Art &amp; Design or Creative Media GCSE subject preferred.</li>
<li>Students who have not taken a GCSE in an Art &amp; Design or Creative Media subject may present a portfolio of work to demonstrate passion, commitment and ability at an acceptable level.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What will I study?</h2>
<p>In the first year you will study a series of projects based upon four Artistic Disciplines: Fine Art, Textiles, Architecture and Illustration. After this you will be given much more freedom to interpret themes for personal study based upon your own interests, practical strengths and using media ad processes from one of the earlier four projects.</p>
<h2>What could I do next?</h2>
<p>Developing creativity and imagination is becoming increasingly valued in many fields of study as well as a range of careers outside of the arts. After further study a professional career in the creative industries can include work in advertising, architecture, product design, illustration, fashion, teaching, media, set design or even as a professional artist.</p>]]></mainContent>
