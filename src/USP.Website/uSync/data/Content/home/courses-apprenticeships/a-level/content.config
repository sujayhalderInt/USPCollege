<p>If you are not sure which career or job you want to do, A-Levels are a perfect way of combining a selection of subjects to help you keep your options open. If you do know which career or job you want to do, then our <a data-udi="umb://document/08805402bfbe40778984a5a649454a6c" href="/{localLink:umb://document/08805402bfbe40778984a5a649454a6c}" title="Get the Career You Want">career packages</a> will help you choose the right course combinations for you.</p>
<p>You study three A-Levels over two years, which are generally examined at the end of each course. You can also choose to study a combination of A-Levels and professional courses, details of which can be found in our A-Level courses section.</p>
<p>They are a great qualification to study if you want to go to university, as many Higher Education (HE) courses require specific A-Levels or combinations.</p>
<p>It is also recommended that you take Core Maths alongside your A-Levels. It is ideal for students that have achieved a Grade 4 or above in GCSE Maths and who need to be equipped for the mathematical and quantitative demands of HE courses or employment.</p>
<p>You may also be able to study the <a data-udi="umb://document/0c3e719900844be5bc44d8b55644078e" href="/{localLink:umb://document/0c3e719900844be5bc44d8b55644078e}" title="Extended Project Qualification (EPQ)">Extended Project Qualification</a> (EPQ) which is recognised by many top universities.</p>
<p>If university is not for you, you also have the option to progress straight into employment or go on to a professional or work-related qualification such as a Higher or Degree Apprenticeship.</p>]]></mainContent>
