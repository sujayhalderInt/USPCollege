<h4><a data-udi="umb://document/9343ba1098214423b6f6a9607dccea3c" href="/{localLink:umb://document/9343ba1098214423b6f6a9607dccea3c}" title="Our A-Level courses"><strong>Academic (A-Levels) </strong></a></h4>
<p>If you are not sure which career or job you want to do, A-Levels are a perfect way of combining a selection of subjects to help you keep your options open. If you do know which career or job you want to do, then our <a data-udi="umb://document/08805402bfbe40778984a5a649454a6c" href="/{localLink:umb://document/08805402bfbe40778984a5a649454a6c}" title="Get the Career You Want">career packages</a> can help you choose the right course combinations for you.</p>
<p>You study three A-Levels over two years, which are generally examined at the end of each course. You can also choose to study a combination of A-Levels and subsidiary courses, details of which can be found in our Academic course section.</p>
<p>They are a great qualification to study if you want to go to university, as many Higher Education courses require specific A-Levels or combinations. You may also be able to study the Extended</p>

<p>If university is not for you, you also have the option to progress straight into employment or go on to a professional or work-related qualification such as a Higher or Degree Apprenticeship.</p>
<h4><a data-udi="umb://document/05a1c6dda4384f10b1f68836ce3534e1" href="/{localLink:umb://document/05a1c6dda4384f10b1f68836ce3534e1}" title="Our Professional courses"><strong>Professional (Vocational) </strong></a></h4>
<p>Professional courses are a popular and recognised alternative to A-Levels. They provide you with a career focused route, allowing you to apply acquired theory and knowledge so that you leave us career ready. You will focus on one professional route, so these qualifications are ideal if you have an interest in a specific sector or industry.</p>
<p>The courses (e.g. AAT, BTEC, UAL, CACHE and OCR) are equivalent to A-Levels and well-regarded by universities, allowing you to progress to Higher Education. You may also be able to study the EPQ which is recognised by many top universities.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could move on to a work-based qualification such as a Higher or Degree Apprenticeship or directly into employment within the same or related area that you have been studying.</p>

<p>Whether you have a recognised learning difficulty and/or disability, or little to no formal qualifications, we have courses available to enable your progression. From advancing to employment, to developing the knowledge to study a mainstream course at the college, each of our programmes are tailored to your needs.</p>

<p>Apprenticeships come in all different shapes and sizes, combining hands-on training with academic study. From Levels 2 to 4, between 12 to 18 months in duration, our Apprenticeships are tailored to your needs. They are ideal if you would like to get ahead in a particular industry.</p>
<p>You will typically spend one day a week in college and four in the workplace. You are treated the same as any other employee receiving benefits such as sick pay, holiday pay and a wage.</p>
<p>After completing an Apprenticeship, you could go on to further training with a Higher or Degree Apprenticeship or related professional qualification.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could use your qualification to progress to university or be offered full-time employment, like around 89% of our apprentices*.</p>
