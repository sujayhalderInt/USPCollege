The course curriculum was really interesting and I found the foundation degree stimulating.\nFor me, it was convenient as I am local so it wasn't far to travel. All of the teachers were very supportive and friendly.\nIt feels really good and all worth it having graduated. If I could give one piece of advice to someone thinking of studying the course would be if you are committed to go for it.",

I've enjoyed getting to know the other students too, it feels like we're a group of friends now. \nIt had always been my ambition to be a Nursery Manager. I left college with a Level 3 Diploma in Childcare to become a full-time Deputy Nursery Manager. In the future I would like to study a Master’s Degree and to work for Ofsted, inspecting Early Years settings. \nHaving graduated feels fantastic – a huge relief! Getting first class Honours was an amazing achievement for me. If I had to offer one piece of advice to anyone thinking of studying the course it would be manage your time effectively.",

Being able to work at the same time as studying has been a perfect fit for me.\nI first realised that I wanted to work at a primary school during a work placement at a specialist SEN school organised by the college as part of my Level 3 Childcare course. After completing my course here I secured a position as a Nursery Manager and was then put forward to be a Trainee Teacher. I will qualify as a Newly Qualified Teacher in September 2016. Long term I would like to be an Early Years SEN Teacher. \nMy advice would be: don't be scared of the hard work involved. Now I have graduated I feel amazing, it’s a great feeling. The hard work was totally worth it!",
