  <mainContent><![CDATA[<h3>To apply to study at either of our campuses please complete our online application form </h3>
<h3>Choosing the right course</h3>
<p>It is really important to ensure that your course choice is suitable for your ambitions now and in the future, whether it is going to university or work after you have finished college.</p>
<p>If you are unsure on what course to take, come along to one of our Open Evenings. Alternatively you can book a careers interview with our fully qualified Careers Advisors by emailing <a href="mailto:careers@uspcollege.ac.uk" title="Email us about applying to USP">careers@uspcollege.ac.uk</a> or calling Seevic Campus <a href="tel:01268%20882 666">01268 882 666</a> or Palmer’s Campus <a href="tel:01375%20370 121">01375 370 121</a>.</p>
<h4>Tuition fees</h4>
<p>If you have lived in the United Kingdom or European Economic Area (EEA) for the past three years and are under 19 on 31 August 2019 at the start of your course, you will not be charged tuition fees, as long as this is your first full width Level 3 qualification. For Adult and HE fees please visit our website uspcollege.ac.uk.</p>
<h4>Resource and course costs</h4>
<p>If you are applying to study a course that requires resources which will be retained, you will be charged for the consumables. You will also be asked to pay for trips that form part of your course (e.g. theatre trips for Performing Arts).</p>
<p>All students will be asked to pay a book fee; more information will be provided when you enrol at the college.</p>]]></mainContent>
