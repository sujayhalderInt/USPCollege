  <mainContent><![CDATA[<h4>What is an industry placement?</h4>
<p>An industry placement is an opportunity for young people to engage themselves in a work situation at a real business or organisation. The young person will carry out a range of tasks or duties, similar to an employee, but with the emphasis placed on the learning aspect of the experience.</p>
<h4>How long does the placement last?</h4>
<p>Typically industry placements consist of a two or three-week block placement. Placements in some sectors, for example, Health &amp; Social Care, may involve a series of shorter placements throughout the year which also total two or three weeks.</p>
<h4>Will we have to pay participants?</h4>
<p>No, you are not expected to pay young people undertaking work experience with your organisation. Some employers do make a contribution towards the cost of travel, however, this is optional.</p>
<h4>Will I meet the young person before their placement?</h4>
<p>Yes, an interview between you and the student will take place prior to the placement. The purpose of the interview is to ensure they are suitable for the placement you are offering. It also forms part of the overall experience for the student. The format of the interview is at your discretion.</p>
<h4>What hours can the young person work?</h4>
<p>Students should work a maximum of 37 hours per week or eight hours per day. Students are expected to work in-line with the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/maximum-weekly-working-hours" target="_blank" title="Working Time Directive">Working Time Directive</a>. </p>
<p><strong>What can I expect from a student at USP College?</strong></p>
<p>You can expect them to be motivated and ready to learn. All participants are aged 16 or over and enrolled on a full-time Level 2 or Level 3 course at the college. Each young person has demonstrated a genuine interest in working in your sector by choosing to study a relevant vocational qualification.</p>
<p><strong>Can we offer more than one placement?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, certainly. We are happy to work with employers who can offer multiple placements to our students.</p>]]></mainContent>
