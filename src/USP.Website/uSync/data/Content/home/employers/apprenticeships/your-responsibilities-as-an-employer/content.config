<h4>Health &amp; Safety Requirements</h4>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">It is the responsibility of you to comply with all health and safety processes. All employers are required to inform USP College (either by telephone or email) of any accidental or non-accidental occurrences arising and resulting in serious injury to the apprentice.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">Before the apprentice begins their training, a college representative will undertake a health and safety assessment of the workplace.</span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">Employer &amp; Public Liability Insurance</span></h4>
<p>We provide each of our employers with a ‘Safeguarding Guide’. This informs employers of the procedure should an apprentice disclose sensitive or personal information or make an allegation about a colleague or manager within a business.</p>
<p>Employers must also be aware of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prevent-duty-guidance" title="Government Prevent Agenda">Government's Prevent agenda</a>. We will provide you with the documented policy and procedure that you must comply with.</p>
<p>We will also provide contact details for the college's Safeguarding Team to help support your company.</p>
<h4>Equality &amp; Diversity</h4>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">We celebrate cultural diversity and are committed to the promotion of equal opportunities in every aspect of our business.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">We will therefore not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment on the grounds of skin colour, race, national origin, gender, sexuality, marital status, religion, age, social background and special needs including disability. We, therefore, ask all employers to comply with our expectations and standards.</span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">Terms &amp; Conditions of Employment</span></h4>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">It is a legal obligation to ensure that all employed staff have a contract of employment.</span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">Annual Leave </span></h4>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">All apprentices accrue annual leave entitlement from the first day of their employment, including Bank Holidays such as Christmas and Easter.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">The minimum holiday entitlement is between five to six weeks paid holiday per year (28 days for full-time staff). An employer can include Bank Holidays as part of statutory annual leave.</span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">Grievance &amp; Disciplinary </span></h4>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">An apprentice is subject to the same terms and conditions of employment as other employees and therefore the above policies and procedures apply.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">In the event of a grievance or disciplinary procedure, USP College will only act in an advisory capacity in terms of learning and training but we may be able to help so please keep us informed if you are having any issues with your apprentice.</span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">Termination &amp; Notice</span></h4>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">A notice period of one week must be provided for employees with continuous employment of more than one month but less than two years (unless a contract specifies longer).</span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">Complaints Procedure</span></h4>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">If you wish to raise a complaint in the first instance please contact the Head of Learning for Apprenticeship. A full complaints procedure is included in your Apprenticeship contract and agreement.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 11.25pt 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: #333333;">All complaints will be acknowledged within seven working days.
