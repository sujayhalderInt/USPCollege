<p>Students choose to study an HE course with us because of the opportunity to study locally, the positive feedback we receive from students and the outstanding support offered by our specialist teachers.</p>
<h3>Why study Higher Education at USP College?</h3>
<p>There are many reasons to study at USP College, not least because we were just one of 10 colleges in England to achieve 100% satisfaction for the quality of our Higher Education courses in the 2017 National Student Survey and 100% of our students have gone onto employment or further study, of which 76.2% was in a highly skilled sector.*</p>
<p>Students also choose to study with us due to our small class sizes, the outstanding support they receive and because being on the doorstep saves them thousands of pounds on living and accommodation costs!</p>
<h3>Guaranteed Place</h3>
<p>Students who have completed a relevant Level 3 course with us are guaranteed a Higher Education place at the college, subject to meeting the entry requirements.</p>
<p>If you’re a Level 3 USP College student who progresses on to the Sports Degree you could also be entitled to a £1,500 bursary per year.</p>
<h3>Student Finance</h3>
<p>There are a number of options to help you pay for your Higher Education course, including tuition fee loans and maintenance loans or grants.</p>
