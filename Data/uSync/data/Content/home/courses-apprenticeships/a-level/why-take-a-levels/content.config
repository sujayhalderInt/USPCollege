<h3>USP College has a proud tradition of offering A-Levels to young people in Essex. We offer the widest A-Level subject choice locally, combined with some of the best results around.</h3>
<p>However, being an A-Level student with us is about more than studying. It’s also about meeting new people, developing new interests and, with our help, progressing towards your dream career or university course.</p>
<h3>10 reasons why students choose to study A-Levels with us:</h3>
<h4>1. Widest choice of subjects</h4>

<p>We don’t restrict your subject choices to defined combinations or blocks. This means that it’s very likely you’ll be able to study any combination of our A-Level subjects. </p>
