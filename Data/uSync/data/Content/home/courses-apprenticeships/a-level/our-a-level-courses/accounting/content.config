  <mainContent><![CDATA[<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>A qualification in Accounting is useful for a range of careers. There are many users of accounting information: managers, shareholders, customers, suppliers and the wider public. These users require information for a variety of purposes and it is important that it is prepared accurately and interpreted meaningfully.</p>
<h2>Entry Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Average point score* of 4.5 or above, calculated from all GCSE subjects. Your point score MUST include at least five GCSEs at grade C/4 or above - including English Language or Maths.
<ul>
<li>If your English Language is a D/3, your Maths must be at least a C/4 and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grade B/6 in GCSE Maths</li>
<li>Grade C/5 in GCSE English Language.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What will I study?</h2>
<p>The course covers both financial accounting and management accounting.</p>
<p>You will build knowledge of key concepts, principles and techniques which will enable them to solve problems logically, analyse data methodically and make <br />reasoned decisions.</p>
<p>Financial accounting focuses on the recording of past events. You will gain a good understanding of the double entry model and accounting principles and concepts in order to verify the accuracy of the bookkeeping and correct any errors. You will also prepare financial statements for sole trader businesses, partnerships and limited companies, including recording adjustments by applying knowledge of accounting concepts.</p>
<p>Management accounting focuses on using accounting information for planning and decision making. Students will learn about budgeting and variance analysis as a means of monitoring and controlling business performance. The course will also use techniques such as investment appraisal in order to evaluate alternative projects.</p>
<h2>What could I do next?</h2>
<p>After A-Levels, you could go straight into a career in Finance or Accountancy. Former students of this course have gone on to work at prestigious accounting firms in the city including PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p>
<p>A-Level Accounting is very helpful if you are considering an accounting/economics or business related degree at university. Prospects for accounting graduates are extremely good; employment may be found within financial institutions, accountancy firms, banking and management.<br /><br />This A-Level is excellent preparation for professional studies in accounting.</p>]]></mainContent>
