  <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>We aim to facilitate this by creating a positive learning environment for our students, who are at the heart of the college, by embedding our values and behaviours in every part of our college.</p>
<h3>Our Values &amp; Behaviours</h3>
<ul>
<li>Respect</li>
<li>Accountability</li>
<li>Resilience.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a college, we promote open discussion around these three key areas so individuals can find what these mean to them and to demonstrate these within their everyday lives.</p>
<h3>Classroom expectations</h3>
<p>We also set classroom expectations for all our students, so they are ready to learn.</p>
<h4>Be reliable</h4>
<p>Being on time and organised is professional if we all attend on time, we create a productive learning environment.</p>
<h4>Be engaged</h4>
<p>Save your headphones for outside the classroom - you need to be focused on communicating with your teacher and peers.</p>
<h4>Be presentable</h4>
<p>Ditch your coats and hats, durag and hoods while in college - look professional.</p>
<h4>Be ready</h4>
<p>Please have your equipment ready and check your mobile phone is on silent and in your bag.</p>
<h4>Be visible</h4>
<p>Identify yourself as a student by wearing your lanyard at all times - it will help to keep you safe in college.</p>
<h4>Be respectful</h4>
<p>Being a professional individual by not only being respectful of staff but also your peers and the environment.</p>
<h4>Be resilient</h4>
<p>Reacting positively with a growth mindset to successes and challenges.</p>]]></mainContent>
