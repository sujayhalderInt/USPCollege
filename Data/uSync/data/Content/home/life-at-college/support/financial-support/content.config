</ul>
<h2><strong>Adult</strong></h2>
<h3>Adults who are aged 19 or over before 31 August in the year they want to study are expected to fund the cost of their learning at college.</h3>
<p>Fees vary depending on the type of course and not all Adult learners have to pay. However, if you do, there are a number of ways to help with the cost of studying.</p>
<p>We may be able to offer financial assistance with course-related costs through our Discretionary Learner Fund or Childcare Support Funds.</p>
<h4><strong>The Discretionary Learner Support Fund</strong></h4>
<p>If your household income is under £21,000 and you are in receipt of certain benefits you may be eligible for monthly discretionary learner support to help with essential course costs, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transport – public transport, or the college bus</li>
<li>Equipment for your course – books and materials</li>
<li>Trips – if these are an essential part of your course</li>
<li>DBS check – if required for your course</li>
<li>Childcare costs</li>
<li>Help with the cost of eating at college.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Advanced Learner Loan</strong></h4>
<p>If you are studying a Level 3 or 4 qualification you could be eligible for an Advanced Learner Loan. <a data-udi="umb://document/84a65ba9c08c480198c48a867663fbc2" href="/{localLink:umb://document/84a65ba9c08c480198c48a867663fbc2}" title="Advanced Learner Loan">Find out more.</a></p>

</ul>
<h2><strong>Higher Education</strong></h2>
<h3>There are a number of financial support options which can help to pay for a Higher Education qualification.</h3>
<p>They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuition Fee Loan to cover the cost of your course (full and part-time students)</li>
<li>Maintenance Loan to help with living costs (full-time students only)</li>
<li>Special Support Grant instead of a Maintenance Grant if you qualify for Income Support or Housing Benefit (full-time students only)</li>
<li>Extra help may also be available if you are on a low income, have children or dependent adults, or are disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to pay back Tuition Fee Loans and Maintenance Loans once your income is £25,000 or over, but not other student finance, for example, grants and bursaries. You still have to repay your student loan if you leave your course early.</p>
