  <mainContent><![CDATA[<h3>Sometimes you can face problems inside and outside of college that can make things difficult for you but our trained advisors are here to support you!</h3>
<p>If you are experiencing difficulties at home, at the college or have personal problems of any kind, we have a number of people on hand to help.</p>
<p>Our team of Wellbeing Advisers offer a discrete, one-to-one service that offers you the opportunity to work with someone that can help you through the difficulties you're facing. Where appropriate, they can also secure the help you need outside of college.</p>
<p>We work closely with many organisations including Essex County Council, Canvey Island Youth Project, CAMHS, Therapy For You and Samaritans.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how we can help you or someone else, please drop into Student Services for a chat, ring <a href="tel:01268882666" title="Call USP College support">01268 882 666</a> or email <a href="mailto:yourfuture@uspcollege.ac.uk" title="Email USP College support">yourfuture@uspcollege.ac.uk</a>.</p>]]></mainContent>
